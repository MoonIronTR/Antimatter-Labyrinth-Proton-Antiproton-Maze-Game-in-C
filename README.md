Antimatter Labyrinth: Proton-Antiproton Maze Game
Welcome to the Antimatter Labyrinth, a C-based terminal game where you navigate a maze to gather antimatter particles while avoiding black holes and annihilating particles. Your goal is to reach the exit of the labyrinth with only antiprotons (P-) and positrons (e+) in hand to create antihydrogen. Can you make it through in time?

Features
Particle Mechanics: Collect and manage subatomic particles (P+, P-, e-, e+) along the way.
Maze Navigation: Use arrow keys to move through the maze. Avoid walls, black holes (K), and traps.
Annihilation Rules: Opposing particles (e.g., P+ and P-) annihilate each other.
Two Game Modes:
User-Controlled: You control the character (represented by x) and move through the maze.
Auto Play: The game runs using a predefined algorithm that navigates the maze on its own.
High Scores: The game stores the top 5 scores with the corresponding usernames.
Multiple Maps: Choose from preset mazes or load your own maze from a text file.
User Management: Create an account and log in to save your scores. Usernames must be unique.
Gameplay Rules
Start the Game:

You must log in or create an account.
Choose to view the top scores, read game instructions, or start playing.
Win Condition: Reach the exit of the maze with only P- (antiprotons) and e+ (positrons) to successfully create antihydrogen.

Particles:

P+: Proton
P-: Antiproton
e-: Electron
e+: Positron
Opposite particles annihilate each other upon contact.
Black Holes: Represented by K, black holes will end the game if you land on them.

Navigation:

Move using the arrow keys (↑, ↓, →, ←).
Avoid walls and boundary edges.
Your character is represented by x, and the screen updates after each move.
Escape (Esc) to exit the game.
Time Limit: You must complete the maze within a time limit. Failing to do so ends the game.

Auto Play Mode: The game can automatically play using a pre-programmed algorithm. The board state and collected particles will still be displayed after each move.
